# Deployment of Openstack using Devstack


# All in one deployment

There is more than one way to deploy openstack. Devstack is one of the tools available for us to use to deploy openstack. To deploy openstack using devstack we will be using the repo from [https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack/src/branch/master](https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack/src/branch/master). This repo will have all the required dependencies. We used Ubuntu 22(Jammy) to deploy devstack. 

Ensure that your OS has been updated and upgraded. Use git to clone the repo to a folder or a workspace for your openstack. Before deploying there are certain changes that you would need to make before running the script. Locate inc/python file. Locate the script line below and change it.

before:


```
$cmd_pip $upgrade \
```


After:


```
$cmd_pip $upgrade  $install_test_reqs --ignore-installed\
```


This command line ensures that you do not download any unnecessary packages that are already installed. Next copy the local.conf file in the samples folder into the main devstack folder. In the local.conf file make changes to the passwords.


```
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
DATABASE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
RABBIT_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
```


And also put in your host ip address.


```
HOST_IP= <your_host_ip_address>
```


It is not recommended to put a static ip address. Instead put this script line.


```
HOST_IP=`ifconfig eth0 | sed -ne 's/.*inet addr:([^ ]*).*/1/p'`
```


Once everything is done, you can begin to run the script by typing ./script. It will take about 15-20min for the packages to be installed after which you will be able to access the horizon dashboard. Devstack is not the most latest addition, thus, there will be missing services in this deployment.
